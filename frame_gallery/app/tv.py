"""Push a JPEG to a Samsung Frame TV's Art Mode, replacing the previous one.

Built on samsungtvws (the library the core samsungtv integration uses). The
point over a generic art-changer: uploads do NOT pile up. Each cycle uploads the
new piece, selects it, then deletes the one it replaced - the art library stays
at one Frame Gallery image per TV.

Safety ordering, per TV:
  1. upload + select the NEW image      (throws -> change nothing; old stays up)
  2. record new id, queue old to delete (durable, before any delete runs)
  3. delete queued old ids               (failures retried next cycle)
Only ids we uploaded are ever deleted.
