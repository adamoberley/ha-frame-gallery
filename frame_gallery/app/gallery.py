"""Choose the next artwork: gather candidates, filter, dedupe, download.

Filters applied to every candidate:
  - public-domain only (if enabled)
  - family-safe keyword blocklist (title/artist/department/classification/terms)
  - not shown recently (the no-repeat history)
The first survivor whose image actually downloads wins; if a batch yields
nothing usable we re-roll (a fresh random page) a few times.
