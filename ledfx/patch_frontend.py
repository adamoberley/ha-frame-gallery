"""Make the bundled LedFX web UI work under Home Assistant ingress.

Two fixes are applied to the (minified) frontend, both required for it to run
behind the HA ingress proxy *and* on the LAN:

1. Backend host. The stock frontend resolves its backend as:

       host = isStandaloneApp() ? "http://localhost:8888"
                                : window.location.href.split("#")[0]

   Behind ingress (and on first load) it can take the ``localhost:8888`` branch,
   so every API call and the data WebSocket target the *browser's* machine.
   We rewrite that hard-coded fallback to the page's own origin.

2. Router basename. This is the HASS-optimised build (``PUBLIC_URL="."``), which
   gives the relative asset paths ingress needs — but it also sets the React
   Router to ``basename:"."``, which the router normalises to ``"/."``. No real
   URL starts with ``/.``, so the router "won't render anything" → a blank page
   (confirmed via the browser console). We replace it with the *actual mount
   path* (``new URL(document.baseURI).pathname``): ``/`` on the LAN, and
   ``/api/hassio_ingress/<token>/`` under ingress — so the router matches and
   renders in both.

We also de-brand the page title and clear any stale cached ``localhost`` host.
Idempotent: safe to run more than once.
