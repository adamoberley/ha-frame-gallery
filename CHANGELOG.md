# Changelog

## LedFX 1.0.1 — 2026-06-25

- Fix a startup crash on boxes with no sound card ("tuple index out of range" in
  audio-device enumeration) by shipping a null ALSA default device. Audio still
  arrives over the network via Sendspin.
- Ensure the git-pinned engine (past 2.1.9) is in the image, so the Sendspin
  watchdog fix and now-playing metadata are present.

## LedFX 1.0.0 — 2026-06-25

First release of a third add-on in this repository: **LedFX**, the real-time,
audio-reactive LED controller, running natively on Home Assistant OS.

- Ships the **LedFX engine pinned just past 2.1.9** (upstream commit `90bebef8`)
  with the ingress-ready LedFX web UI — the post-release pin brings the **Sendspin
  watchdog fix** (no more idle "no audio → reconnect" churn) and **Sendspin
  now-playing metadata**.
- **Ingress fixed** — the UI works through Home Assistant ingress (sidebar +
  Nabu Casa), not just on `localhost`. The frontend was patched to use its own
  origin instead of a hard-coded `localhost:8888`, with a stale-host auto-clear.
- **Reachable on the LAN** — the engine binds `0.0.0.0`, so `http://<ha-ip>:8888`
  works directly (the community add-on bound `127.0.0.1` and couldn't be reached).
- **Audio via Sendspin** — takes its audio from **Music Assistant** over the
  Sendspin protocol: no sound card, no second machine, no VBAN-from-a-PC.
- **De-branded** packaging (clean name, icon, logo, panel; no devil-emoji icon or
  "Blade" add-on branding) and a single `log_level` option; the rest lives in the
  LedFX UI and persists in `/data`.

## Local Faces 0.3.0 — 2026-06-21

- **Redesigned dashboard** — a "porch-lantern" console: a live MJPEG viewport as
  the centerpiece that glows amber when a known face is present and coral for an
  unknown one, with a monospace-label instrument styling, light/dark themes, and
  a responsive layout that works on the HA mobile app.
- **Smooth live view** — replaced the polled still image with an MJPEG stream.
- **Capture → confirm → save enrollment** — you now see the captured face before
  naming it, with proper busy states (no accidental double-enrollments).
- **Name from the log** — tap an unknown face in the sightings list and name it to
  enroll it on the spot; the log now stores each sighting's embedding for this.
- **Security fix** — enrolled names are rendered as text (no longer interpolated
  into HTML), closing a stored-XSS vector via a crafted name.

## Local Faces 0.2.0 — 2026-06-21

- **Pluggable recognition model.** New `recognition_model` option: keep the
  bundled, Apache-2.0 **SFace** (default), or switch to a stronger small embedder
  such as InsightFace's **`mobilefacenet_w600k`** (smaller and more accurate, but
  non-commercial license — you supply the `.onnx` via `recognition_model_url` or
  `/data/models`, accepting its license).
- ArcFace-style ONNX models run via `onnxruntime` with standard 5-point alignment
  (new `align.py`); SFace keeps using OpenCV's built-in alignment. A shared
  embedder interface (`embedders.py`) hides the difference from the rest of the app.
- Enrollments are now **namespaced by model** in `faces.json`, so switching models
  doesn't mix incompatible embeddings; v1 (SFace-only) files migrate automatically.
- Dashboard status line shows the active recognition model.

## Local Faces 0.1.0 — 2026-06-21

First release of a second add-on in this repository.

- **On-device, open-source face recognition** for Home Assistant: pulls frames
  from an RTSP/HTTP stream (or polled snapshot URL), detects faces, and matches
  them against people you enroll — all on the CPU, light enough for a Pi 4/5.
- **Open models:** YuNet detector + SFace embedder (Apache-2.0, OpenCV Zoo) via
  OpenCV's bundled DNN — the open counterpart to UltraFace + MobileFaceNet.
  Downloaded once to `/data/models` on first start.
- **Enrollment dashboard (ingress):** add people by capturing from the live
  camera or uploading a photo; live annotated view; a recognition log with
  snapshot thumbnails.
- **HA integration:** publishes a `Recognized Name` sensor via MQTT discovery
  (auto-detects the Mosquitto broker add-on); optional push notification via any
  HA notify service, with a per-identity cooldown.
- **Local by default:** recognition, enrollment, and the log never leave the box;
  only a notification can.
- Tunable: Fast/Balanced/Accurate processing size, match threshold, minimum face
  size, and detection interval.

## Frame Gallery 0.1.0 — 2026-06-14

First release.

- Self-running Home Assistant app: pushes curated art to a Samsung Frame TV's
  Art Mode on an interval — no automation required.
- **Art Institute of Chicago** source (no API key; CC0 public-domain works via
  high-resolution IIIF images), behind a small plug-in `ArtSource` interface so
  more museums can be added.
- **Content control:** public-domain-only by default, a keyword blocklist
  (family-safe), and a free-text search to shape the collection.
- **No repeats:** remembers the last *N* pieces and cycles instead of
  re-rolling at random.
- **No pile-up:** uploads replace in place (upload → select → delete previous),
  so the TV's art library stays at one image per TV.
- **Auto-discovery:** reads the Frame's IP from the Samsung TV integration; the
  push is Art-Mode-aware (won't interrupt live TV).
- **Fit:** any aspect ratio matted like a framed print, or cropped to fill 16:9.
- **Ingress panel:** shows the current piece with a "Show next now" button.
