# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-06-14

First release.

- Self-running Home Assistant app: pushes curated art to a Samsung Frame TV's
  Art Mode on an interval — no automation required.
- **Art Institute of Chicago** source (no API key; CC0 public-domain works via
  high-resolution IIIF images), behind a small plug-in `ArtSource` interface so
  more museums can be added.
- **Content control:** public-domain-only by default, a keyword blocklist
  (family-safe), and a free-text search to shape the collection.
- **No repeats:** remembers the last *N* pieces and cycles instead of
  re-rolling at random.
- **No pile-up:** uploads replace in place (upload → select → delete previous),
  so the TV's art library stays at one image per TV.
- **Auto-discovery:** reads the Frame's IP from the Samsung TV integration; the
  push is Art-Mode-aware (won't interrupt live TV).
- **Fit:** any aspect ratio matted like a framed print, or cropped to fill 16:9.
- **Ingress panel:** shows the current piece with a "Show next now" button.
